                    Our Company Farmers Evergreen's Policies.<br>

                    Date of Application: [26/10/2024]<br>
                
                    Welcome to Farmers Evergreen. We aim to ensure a level playing field, openness, and safety in the marketplace, through which farmers can connect directly with buyers for the mutual benefit of both parties. This policy outlines the guidelines and rules of use of our services.<br>
                    <h2>1. Purpose of the Platform</h2>
                 
                    Our platform is designed:<br>
                    - To allow direct farm-to-buyer sales and avoid the middlemen.<br>
                    - Connect direct buyers with fresh produces and other farm produce to the producers.<br>
                    - Advocate for transparent, fair prices, and sustainability in farming.<br>
                
                    <h2>2. Qualifications</h2>
                
                    - Producers: Any registered producer or duly authorized agents of a producer<br>
                    - Buyers: Any customer or agency looking for fresh produce directly from the farmers
                    Any user with a minimum age of 18 years must be registered and be able to use the platform.<br>
                
                    <h2>3. Product Quality and Standards</h2>
                
                    The farmer should ensure that all the products included satisfy the quality and safety standards within the locality.
                    It is important to describe the products through origin, quality, and certifications-in other words, whether organic or fair trade.
                    Inspect the products upon delivery and raise any discrepancies noted.<br>
                
                    <h2>4. Fair Trade and Pricing</h2>
                
                    The platform would ensure fair and transparent pricing practices. Farmers have the duty to set prices that must reflect the value of the products being sold.
                    In case this is breached
                    Any activity or practice that artificially inflates prices, manipulates demand, or provides false information regarding the availability of products must be entirely forbidden.
                 
                    <h2>5. Privacy and Data Protection</h2>
                
                    Personal information that has been accrued on this platform will only be used to facilitate transactions, enhance the experience for our users, and for analytics of the platform. We do not share user data without consent.
                    Farmers and buyers on our platform agree that neither will use each other's contact information to communicate with each other outside of the platform unsolicited.
                 
                    <h2>6. Code of Conduct</h2>
                 
                    - Respect: The users will show respect and courtesy to each other in all their communications with one another.<br>
                    - Truthfulness: Farmers and buyers shall give all honest and accurate information.<br>
                    - Compliance: All the users have to comply with all relevant local, state, as well as federal laws that pertain to agriculture and food safety.<br>
                
                    <h2>7. Transaction and Payment Policy</h2>
                
                    - All trading has to be made online through the payment channel enabled by the website for safe and transparent trading.<br>
                    - Buyers should pay for products within the required timeframe; farmers have to get the order within the specified timeframe.<br>
                    - The platform might keep payments in escrow pending to ensure that both parties have performed their respective duties.<br>
                
                    <h2>8. Dispute Resolution</h2>
                
                    - It is first resolved through communication with the farmer and the buyer.<br>
                    - If it cannot be resolved, the platform would allow for the holding of mediation services that can lead to a just resolution.<br>
                    - Users agree to the cooperation of the process on dispute resolution from the platform.<br>
                
                    It retains the right to suspend or terminate any user account violating the policy.
                    The accounts of users may be suspended for receiving repetitive complaints, or have been involved in repeated disputes.
                
                    <h2>10. Changes to the Policy</h2>
                
                    This policy may be amended from time to time. Major changes shall be communicated to users, and continued use of the platform will be deemed an acceptance of the revised terms.
                
                    <h2>11. Contact Information</h2>
